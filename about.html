    <h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
    I'm just a regular guy who has made many, many, MANY mistakaes in his past and 
    am now looking forward to building my skillset to be able to contribute to coworkers,
    friends, family, and society. I like building things that work and make sense. i am still learning
    and still growing, but I take coding very seriously. I dont act like i know it all as i know i will
    always be encountered with something I don't know when coding, but all that matters
    is that I (and we if i am someone that inspires you for some reason) to put in the work and to 
    keep pushing.
