    <H2>Objective</H2>
        <p>My name is Christian Russaw and my objective is to grow as a developer by building real, useful projects and apps while
            constantly learning and improving my skills. I'm focused on writing clean
            code, solving problems, being a valuable asset to a team, and proving self-taught
            consistency can beat credentials
        </p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>High school graduate - no degree, just a lot of late nights, tuorials, courses and 
            real world problem solving
        </p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <P>I've worked a wide range of jobs and side hustles-each one taught me something about 
            people, systems, and staying consistent. Now i'm channeling all of that into building
            things that last 
        </P>
